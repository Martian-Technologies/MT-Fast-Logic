   "description" : "Fast Logic has all the functionality of a reguler Logic Gates plus more.\n\nSpeed Up: You can change simulation speed of a Fast Logic creation by pressing U or Crouch + U while looking at a Fast Logic block.\n\nSilicon: By using the multitool in Silicon Convert mode you can convert parts of your creation to silicon. Not only will this make you game less laggy. But it also allows you to hide logic blocks that would be covering your screen. Silicon has the final bonse of compressing any data inside a silicon block whichs allows you to spawn much larger creations.\n\nColored Connections: By using the multitool in Colorizer mode you can change the color of logic gate connection dots. This can be used to orginize your logic creation or it can be used to make art if you are feeling a little creative",
